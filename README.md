# N-queens-problem

This is assignment of Aritificial Intelligence course

Backtracking algorithm:
First solution is slower than second. It can solve in 2 mins for only N where 1 <= N <= 110

Minconflict algorithm:
Second solution is faster then backtracking.  It can solve in 2 mins for N where 1 <= N <= 3000000
